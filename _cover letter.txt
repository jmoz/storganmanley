Dear candidate,

Thank you for your interest in our role.
Please find attached a programming exercise, for you to solve at home. It should not take longer than 2 hours, but there is no time limit for handing in your solution.
In your reply, please remember to rename any *.py files to *.txt.
Feel free to comment with any design decisions, assumptions etc. If successful, the solution will be discussed in a follow-up interview.

Thank you and good luck,
Giulio Agostini and the RAPD team
